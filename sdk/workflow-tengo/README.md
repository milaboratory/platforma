# Platforma Template Engine: Intelligent Workflows Made Simple

*Transform static workflows into intelligent pipelines that make decisions as they process your data.*

The Platforma Template Engine (powered by Tengo) enables bioinformaticians and scientists to:

- Create workflows that automatically adapt to different data characteristics without manual intervention
- Build reusable analysis components that can be combined into sophisticated processing pipelines
- Define smart decision points where your workflow can take different paths based on results
- Handle varying data inputs and quality issues with built-in adaptive logic
- Focus on scientific questions instead of complex workflow orchestration
- Scale from simple analyses to complex multi-stage pipelines with minimal code
- Respond dynamically to unexpected data patterns or computational outcomes

Perfect for researchers who need flexible data processing that can intelligently respond to experimental results, sequence quality, or computational findings - all without requiring extensive programming expertise.
