# Tengo Language

- Tengo is a small, dynamic script language for Go.
- Code example:
  ```
  /* The Tengo Language */
  fmt := import("fmt")
  
  each := func(seq, fn) {
      for x in seq { fn(x) }
  }
  
  sum := func(init, seq) {
      each(seq, func(x) { init += x })
      return init
  }
  
  fmt.println(sum(0, [1, 2, 3]))   // "6"
  fmt.println(sum("", [1, 2, 3]))  // "123"
  ```
- always find and read all the types and functions you are going to use before implementing what you were asked for
- always try finding code examples for similar patterns
- find and read additional types, functions and examples of code if you understand that you dont have enough information
- think really hard
