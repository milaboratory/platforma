# Platforma Repository

## Overview
This repository is a Teng-/TypeScript-based monorepo for the SDK for Platforma bio-informatics platform that provides infrastructure for building data processing workflows with UI components for scientific analysis pipelines.

## Repository Organization
- Uses pnpm as the package manager with workspace support
- Implements changesets for versioning control and managing package updates
- Structured as a monorepo with multiple packages in lib/, sdk/, tools/, etc/ directories
- Uses Turbo for build orchestration and task running

## Block Architecture
- This repository implements SDK to build blocks
- The codebase follows a "Workflow + Model + UI" architecture paradigm for scientific data processing
- Each block typically contains:
  - Workflow: Processes data (often using Tengo scripting language)
  - Model: Defines data structures and interfaces
  - UI: Provides visualization and interaction components (Vue.js based)

## Key Technologies
- pnpm for dependency management
- Turbo for build process orchestration
- Changesets for version management
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vue.js for UI components
- Tengo scripting language for workflow definitions

## Development Process
- Use `pnpm install` to set up dependencies
- Use `pnpm build` to build all packages
- Don't `pnpm changeset` to create version change, manually create files with human-id-style names like angry-insects-doubt.md, and write changes in the changeset format
