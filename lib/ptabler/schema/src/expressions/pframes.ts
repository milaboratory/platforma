 * If there are no matches - value would be replaced with empty string.
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 1:
 * Input: "123___abc.xlsx"
 * Pattern: "\\d+___([a-z]+).xlsx"
 * Result: "abc"
 *
 * @example
 * // Example 2:
 * Input: "123___abc.xlsx"
 * Pattern: "(\\d+)___([a-z]+).xlsx"
 * Result: "123"

 * @example
 * // Example 3:
 * Input: "123___abc.xlsx"
 * Pattern: "((\\d+)___([a-z]+)).xlsx"
 * Result: "123___abc"

 * @example
 * // Wrong example (pattern doesn't match entire string):
 * Input: "123___abc.xlsx"
 * Pattern: "(\\d+___[a-z]+)"
 * Result: "" (empty string, as .xlsx part is missing in pattern, so pattern was not matched)
